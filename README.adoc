= MaiMaiMai

== Introduction

Sometimes I do a lot of research before buying a thing. For example,
when I’m building a new PC, I would carefully pick the parts. A PC has
a certain number of components, such as the CPU, RAM,
motherboard, etc. Usually there are multiple vendors building their
component to similar specs. For example, both Asus and AsRock build
X870 motherboards in the ATA form factor. In fact they both build
multiple SKUs with slightly different specs. All these motherboards
are alternatives I could choose from, and they all have their pros and
cons. I would read/watch reviews from multiple sources and lay them
all out before making a decision.

MaiMaiMai is a simple way to arrange and present all those components
and alternatives.
